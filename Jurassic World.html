		John Hammond (Richard Attenborough), the founder and CEO of bioengineering company InGen, has created a theme park called Jurassic Park on Isla Nublar, a tropical island in an isolated Central American location populated with cloned dinosaurs. 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		After a park worker is killed by a Velociraptor—in spite of an attempted rescue led by the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon (Bob Peck)—the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero), demand that experts visit the park and certify it as safe. Gennaro invites the mathematician Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) while Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill) and paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern). 
		<br/>
		<br/>
		Upon arrival, the group is stunned to see three Brachiosaurus and a herd of Parasaurolophus in the distance.
